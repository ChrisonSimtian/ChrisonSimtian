### [Homelab](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/homelab)
I am a hobbyist homelabber :-) I love tinkering with hardware and at the moment I operate a mini data centre at home running on Proxmox with several virtualized and containerized applications.
Most of this stuff is smart home or media related, but occasionally I also develop and deploy actual applications

I love playing around with everything DevOps related

## Open Source projects I support through contributions

I wrote an extension allowing to automatically register HttpClients for Scrutor
### [MediathekArr](https://github.com/PCJones/MediathekArr)
I am one of the developers behind MediathekArr, an *Arr application that allows germans to (legally!) download TV Shows and movies from our public TV media libraries (ARD, ZDF, etc)
### [NewWorldMinimap](https://github.com/CptWesley/NewWorldMinimap)
I used to be a contributor for a Minimap Tool for Amazon's New World, while I was still actively playing the game and contributed significantly to both the backend and frontend
